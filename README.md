## Description
This application takes in user input and uses the user input to generate a README file. The user is asked a series of prompts to gather information about their application. That data is then rendered into a README boilerplate.


## Installation
To install this application you need to copy the files to your local desktop

## Usage
Start the application by opening 'index.js' in the VS Code Integrated Terminal. Once the terminal pops up, verify the file path. Type 'node index.js' into the terminal to get started. Anser all the prompts as they appear. Once you are finished and the README has been successfully generated, a message saying 'Success!' will appear in the terminal. If, for any reason, the README file failed to generate, an error message saying 'Failed to write to file' will appear in the terminal
